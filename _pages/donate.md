Thank you for your interest in helping the AFCSociety!

While we await our official desgnation as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, please consider donating to your [local food pantry][1], [homeless shelter][2], and/or [immigration legal services provider][3] today.
Every dollar is precious to these organizations, and there is no better way to advance our cause of promoting a Christ-like society than to directly help those in need.
