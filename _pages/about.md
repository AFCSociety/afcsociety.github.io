## Meet the Board

{% include feature_row %}

## Our core belief

> *Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?*
> *When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?*
> *When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'*
>
> *The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me.*
>
> — Matthew 25:35-40

Jesus commanded all who would follow him to welcome the foreigner, to comfort the afflicted, and to *materially* care for those in need.
What He *didn't* say was "...unless they're gay/trans", or "...unless they're here illegally", or "unless they attend a different church than you".
There is no qualifier on the love, humility, and charity of which Jesus taught:
*Everyone* deserves your love;
*Everyone* deserves your devotion;
*Everyone* deserves your assistance.

Any nation claiming to be based on Christian values ***must*** embody these teachings of Christ.

## Our goals

### Social goals

### Legislative goals

* Enhance & expand social welfare programs, such as SNAP, WIC, and Section 8/811/202 rental assistance.
* Adjust Federal Poverty Guidelines for the reality of life in 2025 and beyond.
* Universal childcare for working families, from infancy through pre-k
* Universal free breakfast & lunch programs for public school children.
* Universal before- and after-school programs for public school children.
* Universal, Single-payer healthcare

How we intend to pay for it:
* Raise the Federal Minimum Wage to at *least* $15 per hour, and implement annual Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) based on Federal Reserve inflation estimates for the *upcoming* year.
* Adjust Federal Income Tax brackets for a more progressive tax system, including:
  * lower brackets for low & middle-income earners,
  * additional brackets for high-income earners, and
  * a 90% bracket at income over $2 million per year.
* Implement a Wealth Tax on estates worth more than $50 million.
