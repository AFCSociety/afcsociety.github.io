## Core Principles

> *for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;*
> *naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.'*
>
> *Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?*
> *When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?*
> *When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'*
>
> *The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me.*
>
> — Matthew 25:35-40

Jesus commanded all who would follow him to welcome the foreigner, to comfort the afflicted, and to *materially* care for those in need.
Any nation claiming to be based on Christian values ***must*** embody these teachings of Christ.
