Introducing ***Americans for a Christ-like Society*** -- a non-denominational, multi-faith organization committed to encouraging the principles of love, charity, and humility across American society & politics.

## Where we came from

I first became interested in the question of a "Christ-like society" while watching White Christian Nationalism rear its ugly head live on television, shortly after the results of the 2016 federal elections.

American Conservatives *love* to say that "we're a nation based on Christian values" (a spurious claim, handily refuted by the Founding Fathers themselves in the [Treaty of Tripoli][1]), yet they frequently fail to *enumerate* those values, leading me to the following questions:
1. What does it mean to be a "Christian" in America today? and,
1. What would "a nation based on Christian values" actually look like?

## Where we're headed

I've struggled with both of those questions for almost a decade, and my ultimate conslusion scares me:
**To be a Christian in America today**, according to Conservative rhetoric, you must:
* Hate immigrants, especially the undocumented;
* Blame the poor, especially those on welfare;
* Ignore suffering, even that of children; and,
* Force your particular brand of beliefs on as many people as possible.

Therefore, a nation based on these values must necessarily:
* Violently detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally;
* Defund social welfare programs to prevent anyone from defrauding the system;
* Hold back food assistance funding, regardless of how many children will go hungry;
* Spend millions of dollars putting Trump Bibles in every classroom, even as basic reading comprehension plummets year-over-year.

## What we can do about it
